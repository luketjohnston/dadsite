      OIL PORTRAIT PAINTING PROCEDURE
    </h2>
    <div id="process"> 
      <p> Scott Johnston will meet with the client to obtain all information 
          needed to complete an oil portrait. The initial meeting is spent 
          getting to know the subject and discussing various aspects of the portrait, 
          including where it will hang, size and style, clothing to be worn, 
          and background and prop options. </p>

      <p> A photo session will take place with the subject being photographed in 
          various poses. Artist and client will review the photos and favorites
          will be selected as reference for the final oil portrait. </p>

      <p> On a subsequent day, Johnston will spend several hours painting a color
          study of the subject from life. The final oil portrait is painted in 
          the artist’s studio using approved photos and color study. </p>

      <p> Johnston will assist in selecting the best frame for the art work so that the 
          final oil portrait can be delivered framed and ready to hang. </p>

      <p> Completion time varies, depending on artist’s schedule and complexity of job. </p>

      <p> FEES start at $20,000.  </p>
